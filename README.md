# Cosmos.md

*Cosmos.md* is an online [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) based [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) note editor, inspired by Obsidian.md and Roam Research.

The deployment is currently down because Heroku closed their free tier and I haven't had time to fix deployment pipelines.

The project is my final assigment for Fullstack Open course. The assigment review by the course teacher can be read (in Finnish) from [here](https://github.com/ignon/cosmos.md/issues/1).
