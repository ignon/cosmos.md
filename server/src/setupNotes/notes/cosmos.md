# Cosmos.md

*Cosmos.md* is an online [[markdown]]-based [[zettelkasten]] note editor.

Cosmos uses open-source [ToastUI Editor](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor) so that notes can be editod in [[wysiwyg]] mode. Editing mode can be switched between Markdown and [[wysiwyg]] by pressing the buttons in bottom-right.

You can navigate between notes by clicking [[wikilink]]s (in editor or sidebar), using search bar or modifying the url in navigation bar (and using next/previous page browser buttons). [[wikilink]]s can be created between notes by surrounding text with two square brackets.

Notes which have [[wikilink]] to our current note can be seen in sidebar under **linked references** (in bold, and notes to which they link to can be seen in *cursive*).
Notes that are linked to from our current note can be seen under **references** title.

New notes can be created by searching for non-existent note and clicking "Create", or by writing non-existent note name to address bar, or by creating a wikilink to [[non existent note]] and clicking it

You can test modifying and creating notes when not logged in but *NOTHING WILL BE SAVED*!
