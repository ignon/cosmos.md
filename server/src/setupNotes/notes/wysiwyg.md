# WYSIWYG

An acronym for *What You See Is What You Get*, is a system in which editing software allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.

Editing mode can be switched between [[markdown]] and wysiwyg-mode by pressing the buttons in bottom-right.
